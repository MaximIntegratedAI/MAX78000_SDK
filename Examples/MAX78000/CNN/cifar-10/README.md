## Description

CIFAR-10 is a simple object classification test, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIFAR-10. The input size is 3x32x32.

The code is auto-generated by the ai8x-synthesis tool and runs a known-answer
test with a pre-defined input sample. This example will be enhance with live capture and TFT
output in the near future.

## Required Connections

-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN1 (USB/PWR) connector.
-   Connect pins 1 and 2 (P0_1) of the JH1 (UART 0 EN) header.
-   Open an terminal application on the PC and connect to the EV kit's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1.

## Expected Output

The Console UART of the device will output these messages:

```
*** CNN Test ***

*** PASS ***

Time for CNN: 1685 us
```
